# Io 
Io is a dynamic prototype-based programming language created by Steve Dekorte in 2002.
He was trying to learn how languages worked to help Dru Nelson, with his language, Cel.

# Run
If you're using OSX you can simply brew install io. For any other OS you will need to build from source.
Running is then a simple command
```bash

```
