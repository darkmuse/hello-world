# Rust 
Developed by Graydon Hoare as a personal project while working at Mozilla Research in 2006. 
Rust is seeing rapid adoption especially popular for systems programming. 
In December 2022, it became the first language other than C and assembly to be supported in the development of the Linux kernel.

# Run
You will need to set up a Rust environment (see https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) then run the program with cargo:
```bash
cd hello-rust
cargo run
```
