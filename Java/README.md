# Java 
Originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, Java is an object oriented programming language that could be run anywhere.
It compiles to a bytecode that will run anywhere where a Java Virual Machine exists.

# Run
Since Java 11 a single Java file can be run from the command line:
```bash
java HelloWorld.java
```
