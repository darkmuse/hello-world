# Hello, World!
Hello World written in multiple languages, just for fun. 

A personal journey to look into as many languages as possible. 
Obviously I'm only scratching the surface of these languages, unless they grab my attention enough to investigate further. 
If you know the languages well, and notice that I've not been idiomatic, please shout up or submit a PR.

So far I've looked at:

[Java](https://github.com/darkmuse/hello-world/tree/main/Java "Java")

[Rust](https://github.com/darkmuse/hello-world/tree/main/Rust "Rust")

[io](https://github.com/darkmuse/hello-world/tree/main/Io "Io")
